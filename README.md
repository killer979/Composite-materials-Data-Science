# Composite-materials-Data-Science
Graduation qualification work on the course “Data Science Pro”

Description: 
Composite materials are artificially created materials composed of several others with a clear boundary between them. Composites have properties that are not observed in the components individually. At the same time, composites are monolithic materials, i.e. the material components are inseparable from each other without destroying the structure as a whole. A striking example of a composite is reinforced concrete. Concrete perfectly resists compression, but poorly in tension. Steel reinforcement inside the concrete compensates for its inability to resist compression, thus forming new, unique properties.
